//! Tinman is a 64-bit computer chess engine developed by [Mike Leany](http://www.mikeleany.com/).
//! It is a re-write of my old chess engine, [Vapor](http://vapor.mikeleany.com/), into the Rust
//! programming language.

//
//! # Execution
//! To run the engine, you will probably want some kind of user interface. Once the arbiter tool is
//! completed, it can be used to run automated matches without a graphical interface. If you want
//! a graphical user interface, for instance to play human vs computer game, you will need one that
//! is compatible with the xboard protocol, such as
//! [XBoard/WinBoard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/) or
//! [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/). Refer to the documentation for the specific user
//! interface for instructions on how to set up new engines. You will need to give the interface
//! the command to run which is simply the path to the executable.
//!
//! # Additional Tools
//!  - `arbiter` will be a command-line tool meant to facilitate games between two chess engines.
//!  - [`count`](../count/index.html) is a tool which counts the variations from a position to a
//!    specified depth.
