//! Tinman is a computer chess engine developed by [Mike Leany](http://www.mikeleany.com/).
//! It is written in Rust and based on his old chess engine, [Vapor](http://vapor.mikeleany.com/),
//! which was written in C.

//! To run the engine, you will probably want some kind of graphical user interface. You will need
//! one that is compatible with the xboard protocol, such as
//! [XBoard/WinBoard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/) or
//! [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/). Refer to the documentation for the specific user
//! interface for instructions on how to set up new engines. You will need to give the interface
//! the command to run which, in the simplest case, is just the path of the executable.
